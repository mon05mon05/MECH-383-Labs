    "\n",
    "2. It is strongly recommended to complete pre-labs before your experiment time. Pre-labs are handed in together with the experiment and lab report. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Lab report due dates and late policy are given on the course syllabus. \n",

    "4. If your submission relies on additional files to run correctly, it is the responsibility of the student to ensure that all files are included with the submission and named correctly.\n",

    "5. Labs are graded based on the output of each code block. Code that throws errors, supresses output, or otherwise results in **no printed output may not receieve points**.\n",
